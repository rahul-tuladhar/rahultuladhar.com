Chapter 1: An Overconfident Sense
Our minds are built to perceive and imagine what others are thinking as we are social animals.
Often times we are overconfident in our abilty to guess what other's are feeling, think of us, or thinking themselves. There seems to be a 2:1 ratio betwen overconfidence and reality. 
We tend to have more overconfidence the longer we know someone as we feel like we know the other people when we really don't.
